Personal Information may also include “Demographic Information,” such as your gender, marital status, salary, purchasing habits, or similar information. Personal Information may be requested and collected at various locations and on various forms on the site, including but not limited to: registration forms for newsletters and other e-mail communications; registration for membership to the site; registration for participation in contests, sweepstakes, auctions, surveys or other promotions that may be offered on the site; when you submit an inquiry via the site; when you submit an order for wine or other products; or when you communicate or otherwise interact with us via the site. You may always elect not to submit Personal Information, however, as a result, you may not be able to access certain of the site’s features and functionality.<br><br>We may also provide you opportunities to submit Personal Information about other individuals. For instance, you may choose to send a notice through the site to a friend regarding content offered by the site. We will not use the Personal Information of these individuals for any other purpose unless we disclose otherwise at the time you provide the information.<br><br>If you have registered as a member, you may update or modify some of the information that you actively provided through the site, including your e-mail marketing preferences, by logging into your member account. In addition, you may deactivate your member account.
<br><br><b>Passive Collection of Information
<br></b><br>In addition to the Personal Information that you actively provide to us, we or our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect information about you when you use the site. This information may include Demographic Information, browser type, operating system, clickstream data, IP address, mobile device identifiers and other information.

The methods that we and our service providers may use to automatically collect such information include the following:

These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the site. You may disable cookies using your browser’s preferences. However, some features of the site may not function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies. <br><br><b>Web Beacons:</b> We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the site, to monitor how users navigate the site, to count how many e-mails that we sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. <br><br><b>Embedded Scripts: </b>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the site.

Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service.

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by us through the site and does not apply to information obtained or collected by us in any other manner unless expressly stated in this Privacy Policy. Please take a minute to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand our information collection practices, such as the types of information we collect from visitors to the site and how we may use that information. Please also review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of the site.
<br><br><b>
Active Collection of Personal Information
<br></b><br>To access or take advantage of certain features of the site, we may request that you provide personal information. “Personal Information” is information about you that is associated with your name or identity, such as, name, mailing address, e-mail address, credit or debit card account number, birth date, telephone number, or purchase information. Personal Information may also include “Demographic Information,” such as your gender, marital status, salary, purchasing habits, or similar information. Personal Information may be requested and collected at various locations and on various forms on the site, including but not limited to: registration forms for newsletters and other e-mail communications; registration for membership to the site; registration for participation in contests, sweepstakes, auctions, surveys or other promotions that may be offered on the site; when you submit an inquiry via the site; when you submit an order for wine or other products; or when you communicate or otherwise interact with us via the site. You may always elect not to submit Personal Information, however, as a result, you may not be able to access certain of the site’s features and functionality.<br><br>We may also provide you opportunities to submit Personal Information about other individuals. For instance, you may choose to send a notice through the site to a friend regarding content offered by the site. We will not use the Personal Information of these individuals for any other purpose unless we disclose otherwise at the time you provide the information.<br><br>If you have registered as a member, you may update or modify some of the information that you actively provided through the site, including your e-mail marketing preferences, by logging into your member account. In addition, you may deactivate your member account.
<br><br><b>Passive Collection of Information
<br></b><br>In addition to the Personal Information that you actively provide to us, we or our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect information about you when you use the site. This information may include Demographic Information, browser type, operating system, clickstream data, IP address, mobile device identifiers and other information.

The methods that we and our service providers may use to automatically collect such information include the following:
<br><br><b>&nbsp;Cookies:</b> Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a web site. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the site. You may disable cookies using your browser’s preferences. However, some features of the site may not function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies. <br><br><b>Web Beacons:</b> We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the site, to monitor how users navigate the site, to count how many e-mails that we sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. <br><br><b>Embedded Scripts: </b>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the site. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party we work with, is active only while you are connected to the site, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter. <br><br><b>Mobile Device Identifiers:</b> Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information if you access the site through mobile devices. Certain features of the site may require collection of mobile phone numbers and we may associate that phone number with the mobile device identifiers. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we and our third-party service providers may receive this information. 

If we associate any such passively-collected information with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

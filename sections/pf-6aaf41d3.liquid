<br><br><b>Risks &amp; Warnings
<br>Customers should also be aware of the following inherent risks and warnings:<br></b><br>- Alcohol should be consumed in moderation and never in conjunction with operating a motor vehicle or machinery.  Women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.  Alcohol consumption may cause health problems.
<br><br>- A case of wine is heavy, so extra care should be taken when lifting it. If you are concerned about the weight we advise that you transfer the bottles 1 or 2 at a time.
<br><br>- Red wine in particular may cause staining if spilt, so extra care should be taken.
<br><br>- Sparkling wines can be volatile due to the build up of gasses. Extra care should be taken when opening these.</font></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
